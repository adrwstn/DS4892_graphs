/*  July 15th exercises:
 * Question 1: What is a DAG?
 * Answer: Directed Acyclic Graph. basically a set of vertices/nodes that have paths organized in such a way that
 * the general direction of the paths/edges that link vertices together are uniform, i.e. cannot travel backwards to the
 * previous vertex once you arrived at current vertex.
 * In summary: (in this context) Directed-Acyclic means mono-directional and an inability to "back-travel"
 *
 * Question 2: Asymptotically speaking, how does the maximum number of edges |E|
 * in an undirected graph vary with the number of vertices |V| ?
 * StackOverFlow says: "if you have N nodes, there are N - 1 directed edges than can lead from it
 * (going to every other node). Therefore, the maximum number of edges is N * (N - 1)"
 * source:
 *  https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5058406/what-is-the-maximum-number-of-edges-in-a-directed-graph-with-n-nodes
 *
 * Implement an adjacency matrix for a graph where the number of vertices is known in advance.
 * Use the following class template: Anyone actually get time to do this yet between?
 *
 *  July 17th exercises:
 * Given the following table of road distances between selected locations on the Avalon Peninsula.
 * Write a program that will parse road-distances.csv into a graph representation.
 * You may use either an adjacency matrix or an adjacency list to store this data in memory.
 *
 *  July 20th exercises:
 * 1. Using the algorithm in the Shortest Paths video and the data from Fridayâ€™s exercises, calculate (by hand) the
 *  distances from Portugal Cove to all other locations in the table.
 * 2. Starting from the code you wrote on Friday, write a method of your graph class that will calculate the
 *  total road distance between any two points in the graph.
 *
 *  TODO: haven't had time to do 20th exercises yet
